Video Assisted Referee (VAR) was introduced in the Premier League for the 2019-20 season and brought with it its load of controversies. The aim of this project is to analyse the impact of VAR in its initial season. The research questions are the following:

1. What type of incidents was VAR most used for?
2. Is there a gap between the number of overturned decisions for and against each team?
3. In which part of a game is VAR most used, and why?
